This is the second post of series Deep learning - working with text. 

In the [first post](https://curiousdeeplearner.github.io/2018/11/19/Working-with-text/), we were already familiar with some notions and introduction of text as well as build some first models with text. 

In this post, we will together figure out how to create our own dataset for training with text.
